How to play:
Use the Numkeys to select a game mode. The game mode can only be selected when 
a game is started. You can also change the size of the left paddle from long to short or vice versa
using the key <1> or the size of the right paddle using the key <2>. By default, the size of both
paddles is long. Using the key <3> you can also change switch between the slow and fast speeds of the
ball. By default, the speed of the ball is slow. The key <4> switches between Singles and Doubles
variants in each of the game modes, Singles is the default setting.

Game 1 - Tennis A (Singles/Doubles):
Move your paddle up or down to catch the ball and bounce it back to your opponent.
Missed or out-of-bounds ball at the left or the right side of the screen scores one
point for the opposing player. You can bounce the ball off of the top and bottom 
edges of the playfield. Additionally, there are square blocks in the middle of the playfield,
some of which can change the vertical direction of the ball. If the ball goes out of bounds, 
it is automatically served again from a random point on the edge where the ball went out 
of bounds. Each player's score is automatically displayed on player's own side of playfield.
In the Singles variation, each player controls only one paddle on his side of the screen.
In the Doubles variation, each player controls two paddles, both on his side of the screen.
If the ball approaches a paddle closer to the middle from behind, the ball will not bounce
back off of it, but instead will pass through and its direction might change slightly.
The game ends when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new game by pressing <Space>.

Game 2 - Tennis B (Singles/Doubles):
This game has exactly the same rules as the previous game, but there are no blocks in the middle, only
a clean playfield where the ball can move freely from one side to the other. The net in the middle of
the playfield has no effect on the ball. The Singles and Doubles variations are also both the same as 
in Game 1. The game ends when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new game by pressing <Space>.

Game 3 - Hockey A (Singles/Doubles):
This game has exactly the same rules as Tennis, but this time, there are also walls on the sides of the
screen and in the center, which the ball can bounce off of. The center wall normally has a hole in the
middle, through which you can send the ball to the opponent's side of the screen. If the ball hits
one of the walls on the sides of the screen, the wall in the center fills the entire height of the
playfield. The only way to make the hole in the middle reappear is to hit the center wall with the ball.
The Doubles variation is also different from the previous two games. This time, each player controls 
one paddle on his side of the screen and one paddle on the opponent's side of the screen. The game ends 
when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new game by pressing <Space>.

Game 4 - Hockey B (Singles/Doubles):
This game has exactly the same rules as the previous game, but this time, there is no wall in the center.
The Doubles variation is also the same as in the previous game, excluding the center wall.
The game ends when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new game by pressing <Space>.

Game 5 - Volleyball A (Singles/Doubles):
This game has similar rules to Tennis A, but the blocks in the center of the screen affect the ball
differently. Instead of changing the vertical direction of the ball, these blocks change the horizontal
direction, meaning that the ball can bounce back towards you. In the Doubles variation,  the paddles 
work the same way as in Tennis A. The game ends when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new 
game by pressing <Space>.

Game 6 - Volleyball B (Singles/Doubles):
This game has similar rules to Tennis B, but this time, the net in the middle does have an effect on the 
ball. When the ball passes through the net, it has a chance of changing the vertical direction of the
ball, similarly to the blocks in Tennis A. Otherwise the rules are the same as in Tennis B, including the
Doubles variation. The game ends when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new game by pressing 
<Space>.

Game 7 - Ping Pong (Singles/Doubles):
In this game, there is a net in the middle of the screen, which bounces the ball back towards you if the 
ball hits it. In order to send the ball to the opponent's side of the screen, you have to send the ball
above the net. When the ball is directly above the net and is going up, its vertical direction is changed.
If the ball is already going down in this situation, the vertical direction doesn't change. The Doubles
variation of this game works the same way as in Tennis A. The game ends when one player scores 15 points. 
You can start a new game by pressing <Space>.

Game 8 - Shooting Game:
This game is only for one player. The paddle on the right travels from the top of the screen to the bottom
at a constant speed. You can move the left paddle and shoot the ball from the center of it by pressing <X>.
The objective of the game is to shoot the ball in such a way, so that the ball hits the right paddle. If you
succeed in hitting the right paddle with the ball, the screen will briefly flash and you will score one 
point. The scoreboard displays two values. The value on the left represents the number of times you've shot 
the ball. The value on the right represents the number of times you've successfully hit the right paddle 
with the ball. The game ends when you've shot the ball 15 times. Therefore, the best possible score you can
achieve in this game is 15-15, meaning you've hit the paddle 15 times out of 15 attempts. There is no
Doubles variation in this game mode. If you press <4> to switch the mode from Singles to Doubles, there will
be additional paddles on the screen, however, they will have no effect on the gameplay.
