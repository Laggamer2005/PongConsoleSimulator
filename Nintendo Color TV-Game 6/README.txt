How to play:
Use the Numkeys to select a game mode. The game mode can only be selected when 
a game is started. You can also change the size of the left paddle from long to short or vice versa
using the key <1> or the size of the right paddle using the key <2>. By default, the size of both
paddles is long. Using the key <3> you can also switch between the slow and fast speeds of the
ball. By default, the speed of the ball is slow. The key <4> switches between Singles and Doubles
variants in each of the game modes, Singles is the default setting.

Game 1 - Volleyball (Singles/Doubles):
Move your paddle up or down to catch the ball and bounce it back to your opponent.
Missed or out-of-bounds ball at the left or the right side of the screen scores one
point for the opposing player. You can bounce the ball off of the top and bottom 
edges of the playfield. Additionally, there are square blocks in the middle of the playfield,
some of which can bounce the ball back towards you. If the ball goes out of bounds, 
it is automatically served again from a random point on the edge where the ball went out 
of bounds. Each player's score is automatically displayed on player's own side of playfield.
The game ends when one player scores 15 points. 
In the Singles variation, each player controls only one paddle on his side of the screen.
In the Doubles variation, each player controls two paddles, both on his side of the screen.
If the ball approaches a paddle closer to the middle from behind, the ball will not bounce
back off of it, but instead will pass through and its direction might change slightly.
You can start a new game by pressing <Space>.

Game 2 - Tennis (Singles/Doubles):
This game has exactly the same rules as the previous game, but there are no blocks in the middle, only
a clean playfield where the ball can move freely from one side to the other. The net in the middle of
the playfield has no effect on the ball. The Singles and Doubles variations are also both the same as 
in Game 1. The game ends when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new game by pressing <Space>.

Game 3 - Hockey (Singles/Doubles):
This game has exactly the same rules as Tennis, but this time, there are also walls on the sides of the
screen, which the ball can bounce off of. The Doubles variation is also different from the previous
two games. In this game, each player controls one paddle on his side of the screen and one paddle on the 
opponent's side of the screen. The game ends when one player scores 15 points. You can start a new 
game by pressing <Space>.
