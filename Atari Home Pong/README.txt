How to play:
Press <Space> and the light show will disappear. Playfield will appear and the game
is ready to begin.

Pong is like a real table tennis game with bounce sound and movable paddles.
Missed or out-of-bounds ball at the left or right side of the screen scores one
point for the opposing player. You can bounce the ball off of the top and bottom 
edges of the playfield. If the ball goes out of bounds, it is automatically served
again from a random point on the net towards the player who missed that hit. Be sure
to hit the ball squarely with the enter of the paddle. Otherwise an "edge hit" will
cause the ball to shoot off at an unexpected angle - just like real table tennis.

Each player's score is automatically displayed on player's own side of playfield.
The game ends when one player score 15 points. Light show then reappears until you
start another game by pressing <Space>.
