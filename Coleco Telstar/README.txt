How to play:
Use the Numkeys to select a game mode. The game mode can only be selected when 
a game is started. You can also select difficulty levels by using keys <1>, 
<2> and <3>. By default, the console starts on Game 1 and difficulty setting 
Beginner.

Pro - Beginner - The paddles are long, the ball moves at a faster speed.

Game 1 - Tennis:
Move your paddle up or down to catch the ball and bounce it back to your opponent.
Missed or out-of-bounds ball at the left or the right side of the screen scores one
point for the opposing player. You can bounce the ball off of the top and bottom 
edges of the playfield. If the ball goes out of bounds, it is automatically served
again from a random point on the edge where the ball went out of bounds. Each 
player's score is automatically displayed on player's own side of playfield.
The game ends when one player scores 15 points. The ball will then not bounce off the
paddles and no score will be added to either player. You can start a new game by 
pressing <Space>.

Game 2 - Hockey:
This game has exactly the same rules as Tennis, except that each player now controls
two paddles. One of the paddles guards the goal on the player's side of the screen, 
while the other paddle is on the opponent's half of the screen. In addition to the 
top and bottom edges of the playfield, the ball can now also bounce off of the walls
on the left and right sides of the screen. The default controls setting for this game
is Keyboard. It is recommended to use this setting while playing this game, for
better enjoyment of the game.

Game 3 - Handball:
Handball is played only by one player, who controls the paddle in the middle of the
screen. The ball will be served from a random point on the left edge of the screen.
The objective of the game is to reflect the ball back towards the left side of the
screen, where the ball will bounce of the wall. If the player misses the ball and it
goes out-of-bounds, the computer scores one point. Once the computer reaches
15 points, meaning that the player missed the ball 15 times, the game ends. You can
play this game with your friends to see who can last the longest.
