How to play:

Start the game by pressing <Space>. Use the Numkeys to select a game mode. The game mode can only be
selected when the game is started. By default, the console launches with a light show on Game 1. 

Game 1 - Catch:
Move your hole up or down and catch the ball through your hole. The ball never goes out of
bounds, but stays in action until one of the players catches it. That player then scores
one point on his or her side of the screen. The ball is automatically served again towards
the player who caught the ball.
The first player to earn 15 points wins the game. When 15 points are scored, the playfield
disappears and the light show comes back on the screen. To get the playfield back and start
another game, press <Space> again.

Game 2 - Solitaire:
Switch the controls to Keyboard using <LShift> and then use <UP> and <DOWN> to adjust the
height of the wall on the right to your liking. Then switch the controls back to Mouse
using <LShift>. Now use the left paddle to hit the ball through the hole at the top right
side of the playfield. As your technique sharpens, you can raise the height of the back
wall to create a smaller opening.
A missed or out-of-bounds ball at your side of the screen score one point for the game's
computer, and vice versa. The ball is then served again automatically towards you. Your
goal is to get 15 points before the game's computer does. The best possible score is 15-0,
meaning the game never scored at all.

Game 3 - Super Pong:
In this exciting game, each player controls two paddles. It is recommended to play this
with the controls set to Keyboard, for better enjoyment of the game. Both the Forwards 
and Backs reflect the ball if it bounces off the side facing the net. If the ball 
approaches a Forward from behind, the ball will simply pass right through that paddle.
A missed or out-of-bounds ball at your side of the screen scores one point for your
opponent. The ball is then served again automatically towards you. The first player to earn
15 points wins the game.

Game 4 - Pong:
Pong is the classic video game for the purest unadulterated fun. It has the same rules as
Super Pong, except that each player has one paddle instead of a pair.
